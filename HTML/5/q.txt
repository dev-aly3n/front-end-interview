Question:  How Can I Get Indexed Better by Search Engines?  



answer: meta tags are a nice way to give information about our page to the crawlers.
other way is to use right elements in right place. for example we shouldn't put an <a></a> inside another <a> tag
or we must have just 1 h1 in our page.





another answer: 
It is possible to get indexed better by placing the following two statements in the <HEAD> part of your documents:
<META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="keyword keyword keyword keyword">
<META NAME="description" CONTENT="description of your site">
Both may contain up to 1022 characters. If a keyword is used more than 7 times, the keywords tag will be ignored altogether. Also, you cannot put markup (other than entities) in the description or keywords list.
