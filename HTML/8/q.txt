Question: Briefly describe the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements: <header>, <article>, <section>, <footer>



answer: header is the best place to put h1 tag and maybe an image that describe the content.
article or main is a nice place to put out content.
section is here to divide parts of html code. for example footer and main are sections. but if we need other sections that aren't feat with these built-in ones. so we can use section itself.
footer is good to contain about our policy and copy-right and contact data. it should be at the end of the page.




another answer:
<header> is used to contain introductory and navigational information about a section of the page. This can include the section heading, the author’s name, time and date of publication, table of contents, or other navigational information.
<article> is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing it’s meaining. Individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.
<section> is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.
<footer> is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author’s name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.
