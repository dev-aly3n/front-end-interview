Qestion:
 What is the difference between span and div?




 answer: I think div is block and span is inline-block, no more difference




 another answer: 
div is a block element
span is inline element
For bonus points, you could point out that itâ€™s illegal to place a block element inside an inline element, and that while div can have a p tag, and a p tag can have a span, it is not possible for span to have a div or p tag inside.
