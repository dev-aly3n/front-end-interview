Question:  What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production? How would you change/improve them? 



answer: I have used tailwindcss. it's awesome, make me faster building stuff. 
how I would make it better? I think it has a problem with  gathering all css in one file. it is not optimized.
we dont need to load the css of all pages when we meet just one page of website. tailwind should make it happen.






another answer:
Bootstrap - Slow release cycle. Bootstrap 4 has been in alpha for almost 2 years. Add a spinner button component, as it is widely used.
Semantic UI - Source code structure makes theme customization extremely hard to understand. Its unconventional theming system is a pain to customize. Hardcoded config path within the vendor library. Not well-designed for overriding variables unlike in Bootstrap.
Bulma - A lot of non-semantic and superfluous classes and markup required. Not backward compatible. Upgrading versions breaks the app in subtle manners.
