Question: What Selector Nesting in Sass is used for?



answer: for creating better Selector that they point to our specific element with specific attributes we need to write our selector like this: .class1 > .class2 > a > .active {}

as you can see it is hard to implement and also hard to read.

so css nesting suggest us to use a better way like: 

.class1 {
    >.class2 {
        >a {
            >.active{

            }
        }
    }
}




another answer:
Sass let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't have any visual hierarchy.
Consider example (scss):
.parent {
  color: red;

  .child {
    color: blue;
  }
}
Result (css):
.parent {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: blue;
}
