Question: Explain what is a @extend directive used for in Sass?  



answer: I don't know. I don't use sass. but I think it take a class and its property and add them to another class with more property.



another answer:
Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very dry.
Consider:
%message-shared {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

.message {
  @extend %message-shared;
}

.success {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: yellow;
}
CSS output:
.message, .success, .error, .warning {
  border: 1px solid #cccccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

.success {
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  border-color: yellow;
}
