Question: Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?  




answer: yes I did a lot.







another answer:
Yes. Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.
Flexbox solves many common problems in CSS, such as vertical centering of elements within a container, sticky footer, etc. Bootstrap and Bulma are based on Flexbox, and it is probably the recommended way to create layouts these days. Have tried Flexbox before but ran into some browser incompatibility issues (Safari) in using flex-grow, and I had to rewrite my code using inline-blocks and math to calculate the widths in percentages, it wasn't a nice experience.
Grid is by far the most intuitive approach for creating grid-based layouts (it better be!) but browser support is not wide at the moment.
