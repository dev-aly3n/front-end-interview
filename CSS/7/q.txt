Question: What is a CSS rule?  


answer: I don't know.




another answer:

Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:
A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed,
A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to.
A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look.
