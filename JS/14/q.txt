Question: Why would you use something like the load event? Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?




answer: the load event is helpful in some cases but for most of the time we just want to wait until the dom parsing completely. we don't car about images, svgs and etc...
but the load event wait until all of these stuff load. we can use DOMContentLoaded to just wait for html to load.



another answer:
The load event fires at the end of the document loading process. At this point, all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, and all the images, scripts, links and sub-frames have finished loading.
The DOM event DOMContentLoaded will fire after the DOM for the page has been constructed, but do not wait for other resources to finish loading. This is preferred in certain cases when you do not need the full page to be loaded before initializing.
