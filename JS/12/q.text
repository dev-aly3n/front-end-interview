Question: What is the difference between == and ===?



answer: == just check the equality of value , but === check for both value and type. 




another answer:
== is the abstract equality operator while === is the strict equality operator. The == operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. The === operator will not do type conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. When using ==, funky things can happen, such as:
1 == '1'; // true
1 == [1]; // true
1 == true; // true
0 == ''; // true
0 == '0'; // true
0 == false; // true
My advice is never to use the == operator, except for convenience when comparing against null or undefined, where a == null will return true if a is null or undefined.
var a = null;
console.log(a == null); // true
console.log(a == undefined); // true
