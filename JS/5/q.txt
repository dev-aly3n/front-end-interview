Question: Explain equality in JavaScript?



answer: equality has 2 operators. 
first: ==  that means equal in value.
second: ===   that means equal in value and type.
for example 1=="1" will return true but 1==="1" return false because they have different type.




another answer:
JavaScript has both strict and typeâ€“converting comparisons:
Strict comparison (e.g., ===) checks for value equality without allowing coercion
Abstract comparison (e.g. ==) checks for value equality with coercion allowed
var a = "42";
var b = 42;

a == b;			// true
a === b;		// false
Some simple equalityrules:
If either value (aka side) in a comparison could be the true or false value, avoid == and use ===.
If either value in a comparison could be of these specific values (0, "", or [] -- empty array), avoid == and use ===.
In all other cases, you're safe to use ==. Not only is it safe, but in many cases it simplifies your code in a way that improves readability.
