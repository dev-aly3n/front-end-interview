Question: What is a Polyfill? 


answer: I don't know.




another answer:

A polyfill is essentially the specific code (or plugin) that would allow you to have some specific functionality that you expect in current or “modern” browsers to also work in other browsers that do not have the support for that functionality built in.
Polyfills are not part of the HTML5 standard
Polyfilling is not limited to Javascript
