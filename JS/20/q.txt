Question: Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?



answer: to avoid declaring local variable as global variable.




another answer:
Every script has access to the global scope, and if everyone uses the global namespace to define their variables, collisions will likely occur. Use the module pattern (IIFEs) to encapsulate your variables within a local namespace.
