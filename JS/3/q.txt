Question: Explain arrays in JavaScript?




answer: arrays are like objects but the "key" is preserved by index number.
[0:el1 , 1:el2 , 2:el3 ,...]
if we have multiple value of the same key then they should go into an array.
so instead of using objects like this:
let obj = {
    car1: ford,
    car2: benz,
    .
    .
    .
}
we can and should say :
let cars = [ford, benz, ...]






another answer:
An array is an object that holds values (of any type) not particularly in named properties/keys, but rather in numerically indexed positions:
var arr = [
	"hello world",
	42,
	true
];

arr[0];			// "hello world"
arr[1];			// 42
arr[2];			// true
arr.length;		// 3

typeof arr;		// "object"
