Question:  Is there anyway to force using strict mode in Node.js?



answer: what the hell? why should I know this in js section?





another answer:
you can place
"use strict";
at the top of your file in node >= 0.10.7, but if you want your whole app to run in strict (including external modules) you can do this
node --use_strict
