Question: What's the difference between throw Error('msg') vs throw new Error('msg')?



answer: I think that they have no difference.




another answer:

var err1 = Error('message');
var err2 = new Error('message');
Which one is correct and why?
Answer
Both are fine; the function call Error(…) is equivalent to the object creation expression new Error(…) with the same arguments.
