// These are also called the primitive types in TypeScript:
// Number type: it is used to represent number type values and represents double precision floating point values.
var variable_name1: number;
// String type: it represents a sequence of characters stored as Unicode UTF-16 code. It is the same as JavaScript primitive type.
var variable_name2: string;
// Boolean type: in Typescript, it is used to represent a logical value. When we use the Boolean type, we get output only in true or false. It is also the same as JavaScript primitive type.
var variable_name3: boolean;
// Null type: it represents a null literal and it is not possible to directly reference the null type value itself.
var variable_name4:number = null;
// Undefined type: it is the type of undefined literal. This type of built-in type is the sub-type of all the types.
var variable_name5:number = undefined;
