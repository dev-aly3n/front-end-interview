another answer:
Modules in Typescript helps in organizing the code. There are 2 types of Modules — Internal and External
Internal Modules are now replaceable by using Typescript’s namespace.
External Modules used to specify and load dependencies between multiple external js files. If there is only one js file used, then external modules are not relevant.
