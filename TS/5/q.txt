Question: Explain generics in TypeScript?



answer: we can have a function that works for multiple role. then by generics we can say if the argument has the <T> type. then the second argument and the returned value of the function must have the desired type (for example also T type.).




another answer:
Generics are able to create a component or function to work over a variety of types rather than a single one.
/** A class definition with a generic parameter */
class Queue<T> {
  private data = [];
  push = (item: T) => this.data.push(item);
  pop = (): T => this.data.shift();
}

const queue = new Queue<number>();
queue.push(0);
queue.push("1"); // ERROR : cannot push a string. Only numbers allowed
