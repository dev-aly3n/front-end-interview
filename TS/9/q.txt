Question: What is TypeScript and why do we need it?



answer: oh god, another boring question. it's a language that compiles to javascript. we need it because javascript hasn't static type itself.




another answer:
JavaScript is the only client side language universally supported by all browsers. But JavaScript is not the best designed language. It’s not a class-based object-oriented language, doesn’t support class based inheritance, unreliable dynamic typing and lacks in compile time error checking. And TypeScript addresses all these problems. In other words, TypeScript is an attempt to “fix” JavaScript problems.
TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. TypeScript is quite easy to learn and use for developers familiar with C#, Java and all strong typed languages. At the end of day “TypeScript is a language that generates plain JavaScript files.”
As stated on Typescript official website, “TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you really want to. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open Source.” Where “typed” means that it considers the types of variables, parameters and functions.
